# Code analysis for Software Security Engineering
## Part 1: Code Review
### 1.1 Code Review Strategy
Here is the description of the Code review Strategy. <br>
Answer Following question(*Required*):
- What challenges did you expect before starting code review?
- How did your code review strategy attempt to address the anticipated challenges?
#### CWE checklist
### 1.2 Automated Scanning
Document findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to tool outputs.

### 1.3 Manual Reviews

Document findings from a manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases, and threat models.




## Part 2: Key Findings and Contributions
### 2.1 Key Findings
Provide a summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary should include mappings to CWEs to describe significant findings and perceive risk in your hypothetical operational environment.
### 2.2 Contributions
Planned or ongoing contributions to the upstream open-source project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications, etc.) You can discuss planned or in-progress contributions based on any of the prior assignments in the class.

## Team Reflection
